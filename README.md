## ðŸ’»How it is works

The application is basically a place to user write reviews to movies. And he can update de review or delete it. The first page is the login page, and if the user has an account he could enter to the main page
but if he does not have, he can go to register page. Each user has his own reviews, and the reviews is storaged in database, wich means he can close the window, logout of the account and even after it the data will be there.  
For create de server side I've used NodeJs and Express. And through it I was able to connect with my MySQL database and send or receive informations of the FrontEnd. 

### :mag_right: I've used the main HTTP methods:

- POST (to send the informations of the Frontend for the Backend and storage it in our database)
- GET (for Fronend get the informations of the Backend)
- PUT (for frontend update some information in Backend
- DELETE (for frontend send some information to backend delete)
